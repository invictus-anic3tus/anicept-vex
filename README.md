# Anicept Vex
My custom CoreXY 3D printer!

Aimed towards super speed, this printer should wow your senses. Hopefully. Maybe. You know what, do whatever. Read my journal :D

# CAD

You can see the entire CAD file at the Fusion 360 online viewer. Share link: [https://a360.co/429t4vc](https://a360.co/429t4vc)
You can download the entire model with the full_model.step file, and download individual .stl's for 3D printing the parts!

The total design uses four colors, three of which are 3D printed. The main frame and most mechanical parts are silver, most 3D printed parts are black or white, with gold highlights. All these different filament choices were sponsored by Polymaker! Huge thanks to Polymaker Joel for helping me do this. :)

## 3DP RSR Pi

The 3DP RSR Pi, or 3D printer remote shutdown relay for raspberry pi, is a simple but thoroughly-documented concept for a relay that can power off or power on your 3d printer directly from a raspberry pi interface! It shuts down the printer when you shut down the pi, and optionally powers it up when you start the pi. More info [here](https://github.com/invictus-anic3tus/3DP-RSR-Pi).
